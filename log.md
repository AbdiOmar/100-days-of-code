# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 25 June 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have read about challenge "Record Collection" on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** First day of the challenge and... I am stuck with JS. I'll solve it tomorrow after work when I will have more time.

### Day 1: 27 June 2018

 **Today's Progress**: Finished "Record collection" challenge, JS while loops, JS for loops, JS odd numbers with for loops, counting backwards with for loops, iterate through array with for loop
 
 **Thoughts:** It was quite exciting to finish Record collection challenge. I got to work on other aspects of JS as well. Unfortunatelly I couldn't finish it yesterday as I had too much work.

### Day 2: 28 June 2018

**Today's Progress**: Nesting for loops, do while loops and Profile look up challenge on Free Code Camp

**Thoughts:** Profile Look up was nice challenge which required a bit more time than others. I am excited for solving it. I really liked this challenge as it required knowledge of different loops and was more advanced than other ones.

### Day 4: 30 June 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learning JS, specifically: Conditional ternary operators and multiple conditional ternary operators && Reviewing CSS specifically: entire baisc CSS section on Free Code Camp

**Thoughts:** Despite having hard day at work, I ended up being super productive in regards to CSS course. I have done a lot of CSS in past so it wasn't very challenging however I did learn few new things regardless of it. Did 2 challenges in JS. Well that was exciting!

### Day 5: 2 July 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learning JS, specifically: var, let and const keywords.

**Thoughts:** Another hard day at work but despite being so tired I was too curious to not peek what next section, ES6 challenges has to offer. Let and const keywords remind me of getters and setters in Java in some way. I have also found very informative youtube channel "The Coding Train" which is great source of JS.

### Day 6: 16 July 2018

**Today's Progress**: Write Arrow Functions with Parameters, Use Arrow Functions To Write Concise Anonymous Functions, Prevent Object Mutation, Mutate An Array Declared with Const

**Thoughts:** Back from holidays! I was very excited to be able to code again. I got to learn arrow functions which were quite interesting as I have never seen it in other languages that I have learned. It makes code so much shorter but a bit harder to read for those who are not used to it. I can imagine getting used to it and using it more frequently, it's just a matter of learning and a bit of time. The Coding Train youtube channel had some interesting videos which explained it in more depth and with some examples.
