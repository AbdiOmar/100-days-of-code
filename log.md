# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 25 June 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have read about challenge "Record Collection" on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** First day of the challenge and... I am stuck with JS. I'll solve it tomorrow after work when I will have more time.

### Day 0: 27 June 2018

 **Today's Progress**: Finished "Record collection" challenge, JS while loops, JS for loops, JS odd numbers with for loops, counting backwards with for loops, iterate through array with for loop
 
 **Thoughts:** It was quite exciting to finish Record collection challenge. I got to work on other aspects of JS as well. Unfortunatelly I couldn't finish it yesterday as I had too much work.
