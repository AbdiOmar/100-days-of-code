# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 25 June 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have read about challenge "Record Collection" on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** First day of the challenge and... I am stuck with JS. I'll solve it tomorrow after work when I will have more time.

### Day 1: 27 June 2018

 **Today's Progress**: Finished "Record collection" challenge, JS while loops, JS for loops, JS odd numbers with for loops, counting backwards with for loops, iterate through array with for loop
 
 **Thoughts:** It was quite exciting to finish Record collection challenge. I got to work on other aspects of JS as well. Unfortunatelly I couldn't finish it yesterday as I had too much work.

### Day 2: 28 June 2018

**Today's Progress**: Nesting for loops, do while loops and Profile look up challenge on Free Code Camp

**Thoughts:** Profile Look up was nice challenge which required a bit more time than others. I am excited for solving it. I really liked this challenge as it required knowledge of different loops and was more advanced than other ones.

### Day 4: 30 June 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learning JS, specifically: Conditional ternary operators and multiple conditional ternary operators && Reviewing CSS specifically: entire baisc CSS section on Free Code Camp

**Thoughts:** Despite having hard day at work, I ended up being super productive in regards to CSS course. I have done a lot of CSS in past so it wasn't very challenging however I did learn few new things regardless of it. Did 2 challenges in JS. Well that was exciting!

### Day 5: 2 July 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learning JS, specifically: var, let and const keywords.

**Thoughts:** Another hard day at work but despite being so tired I was too curious to not peek what next section, ES6 challenges has to offer. Let and const keywords remind me of getters and setters in Java in some way. I have also found very informative youtube channel "The Coding Train" which is great source of JS.

### Day 6: 16 July 2018

**Today's Progress**: Arrow Functions with Parameters, Use Arrow Functions To Write Concise Anonymous Functions, Prevent Object Mutation, Mutate An Array Declared with Const

**Thoughts:** Back from holidays! I was very excited to be able to code again. I got to learn arrow functions which were quite interesting as I have never seen it in other languages that I have learned. It makes code so much shorter but a bit harder to read for those who are not used to it. I can imagine getting used to it and using it more frequently, it's just a matter of learning and a bit of time. The Coding Train youtube channel had some interesting videos which explained it in more depth and with some examples.

### Day 7: 17 July 2018

**Today's Progress**: Default Parameters for Your Functions, Higher Order Arrow Functions

**Thoughts:** I have read and learned a lot about arrow functions and more about DRY principles. It was a tough bite as it's rather hard thing to read but I have managed to get through it. I am proud of myself as I did extra hour despite being tired. Mozilla web docs and The Code Train (YouTube channel) came quite handy.

### Day 8: 18 July 2018

**Today's Progress**: JS: Destructuring Assignment To Assign Variables From Objects, the Spread Operator To Evaluate Arrays In Place, the Rest Operator with Function Parameters
CSS: half of applied visual design.
Project: started Tribute web page.
**Thoughts:** Since I had day off, I have worked on quite a lot of things. JS challenges difficulty have spiked and it seems like I am not the only one to struggle with them. Despite of it I got through them. CSS challenges were easy and I have started new project for Free Code Camp. I have spend quite a lot of time learning and programming today!

### Day 10: ?? July 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Tribute Page,Learned a lot of JS, HTML and CSS. Started new project- Survey Form.

**Thoughts**: Got sick, busy at work, I have a lot of problems to tackle right now so I wasn't able to update list everyday. I think a quote from Churchill can sum it up well: "If you're going through hell, keep going."

### Day 11: 25 July 2018

**Today's Progress**: JS, finished Applied Visual design on FCC

**Thoughts:** I got really inspired by animation lessons in CSS, I have few projects ideas I could utilise, I really wish I had more time for this. I am almost done with ES6 in JS as well, I thought to give JS a little break after this and try to make some  more projects. Recently I have been heavily focusing on learning on FCC

### Day 12: 26 July 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learning more JS, edited my portfolio website.

**Thoughts:** I have brushed up my knowledge about destructing so I feel more confident about it. Also updated my portfolio website because I haven't done it in a while. I thought to redesign whole thing, I think it's about time to rewamp it.

### Day 13: 27 July 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learning JS, exactly: Importing a default export, Creating An Export Fallback with Export Default,
Use To Import Everything From A File, Use Export To Reuse A Code Block, Understand the Differences Between Import and Require

**Thoughts:** I had hard time focusing on learning today. Recently I have applied to a web developer apprenticeship and I am so excited about it. I wish I would know result of my application (I have written great application) so I could prepare myself ASAP for apprenticeship and start learning programme ahead. Probably I would also quit my job just so I can spend whole days learning and writing up new projects (oh I so wish I could do it now). Also I had a lot of work today hence I didn't had much time today. To be fair there wasn't much that I have learned today, just syntax different from other languages.

### Day 14: 3 August 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Survery form coursework from free code camp. Progress so far 8/17.

**Thoughts:** I don't get why I get score 8/17, I'll have to dig deeper into it. I might also get some little free lance job for a start up business so I was busy with that and... work.

### Day 15: 4 August 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Survery form coursework from free code camp. Progress so far 17/17. Completed all tasks.

**Thoughts:** I think I was really tired yesterday because I have missed few things and misunderstood certain things in FCC coursework explanation. I guess it just meant that today's work on the coursework was dead simple! Tomorrow after work: making it pretty!

### Day 16: 7 August 2018

### Day 17: 9 August 2018

**Today's Progress**: Now survey works on mobile phones and tablets.

**Thoughts:** I don't know why it took me so long to find that semicolon in css. I think I am just too tired and it's 2am but... survey looks so pretty I am proud of it so much. I can't wait to make next project.
